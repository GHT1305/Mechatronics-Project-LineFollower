# Line Follower Robot using ESP32

## Step 1
Upload **ESP32-BT.ino** to your ESP32 board using **Arduino IDE**  
(Board: *ESP32 Dev Module*).  
After uploading, the ESP32 will broadcast a Bluetooth device named **ESP32test**.

## Step 2
Connect your **laptop/PC** to the Bluetooth device **ESP32test**.  
Check which **COM port** it is connected to (you can see it in **Device Manager**).

## Step 3
Download **PC-GUI.py** to your computer.  
Open it in **VS Code**, install all required libraries,  
set the correct **COM port** at **line 4**, and run the `.py` file.
